SoundBoard for Streaming
=======================

Used to map keys from a MIDI keyboard to play sound files.

Sounds simple enough, and it is, but it's really just for streaming purposes.

See the code for details, I'm not going to bother documenting this app as it's entirely for my own use.

Forked from `Sanford.Multimedia.Midi` base code for MIDI interface.
