SoundBoard for Streaming
=======================

Used to map keys from a MIDI keyboard to play sound files.

Sounds simple enough, and it is, but it's really just for streaming purposes.

See the code for details, I'm not going to bother documenting this app as it's entirely for my own use.

The actual application is in [MidiWatcher](Demo/MidiWatcher). Everything is just supporting stuff for Midi etc.

Forked from `Sanford.Multimedia.Midi` base code for MIDI interface.

## Special Keys
* The first knob changes the volume. 
* The second changes the playback speed. Note that this also stops the replay :cry:

## TODO

A better GUI.
